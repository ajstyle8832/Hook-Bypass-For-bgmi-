here are some cases that seem potentially risky and could lead to a 10 minute ban if abused:

Case 7 - Returns a constant value that could trigger a ban.

Case 39 - Sending data, could ban if unexpected data is sent.

Case 42 - Sets global flag byte_3E0AC9, modifying flags may lead to a ban.

Case 47 - Sets a value to 1, changing certain values could trigger cheat detection.

Case 49 - Processes input buffer, may ban for invalid data.

Case 56 - Parses input and sets global pointer, unusual input could be flagged.

Some other cases that stood out:

Case 44 - Calls sub_5D334() with input buffer, may ban for invalid data.

Case 50 - Calls sub_4D1C0() with input buffer, could ban for bad data.

Case 51 - Parses input and checks values, strange input could be risky.

General risks:

    Sending malformed network data.
    Modifying global state unexpectedly.
    Providing weird input that gets parsed.
    Calling functions that do cheat detection.

The safest approach seems to be:

    Avoid cases that take user input.
    Don't modify global state.
    Only call whitelisted cases with valid data.
